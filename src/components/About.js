          I'm a full-stack software engineer, focusing on front-end development.
          Most of my time is spend on researching, studying new web-design
          concepts, and coding. I believe that a web product should be
          functional, scalable and fast. Also, first impression is very
          important, so it must look awesome as well.
        </p>

          In my spare time, you'll either find me shooting hoops, playing the
          guitar, at the park with my doggos, or playing competitive games with
          my son.
